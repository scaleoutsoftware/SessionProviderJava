# ScaleOut SessionProvider Library for Java

## Introduction

The ScaleOut SessionProvider library for Java allows developers to use ScaleOut StateServer to serve Java HttpSessions from the in-memory data grid to a web application. The Java HTTP session-state provider implements the Filter interface to store HTTP session objects within a specified named cache in the in-memory data grid.
